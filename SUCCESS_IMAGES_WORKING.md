## 🔄 Maintenance

### To Keep Images Working:

1. **Don't delete the symlink**
   - Location: `public/storage`
   - Points to: `storage/app/public`

2. **Maintain permissions**
   - Storage: 755
   - Owner: www-data (or your web server user)

3. **After Laravel updates**
   - May need to recreate symlink
   - Run: `php artisan storage:link`

4. **Regular backups**
   - Backup `storage/app/public/` folder
   - Contains all uploaded images

## 🆘 Future Troubleshooting

If images stop working in the future:

### Check 1: Symlink Exists
```bash
ls -la public/storage
```
Should show symlink, not a directory

### Check 2: Test URL
```bash
curl -I https://api.neelayurvedics.in/storage/test.jpg
```
Should return HTTP 200 (or 404 if file doesn't exist)

### Check 3: Permissions
```bash
ls -l storage/app/public
```
Should show 755 permissions

### Quick Fix:
```bash
php artisan storage:link
chmod -R 755 storage
php artisan config:clear
```
